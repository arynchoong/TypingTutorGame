                <h1>Typing Tutor Game</h1>
                <p>Typing Tutor was a software to teach typing skills. Version IV was created by Simon and Schuster in 1987, with Driya Systems, on Windows DOS.</p>
                
                <p>The software also includes a game after every lesson that allows the user to practice typing.</p>

            <h2>Game play</h2>
            
            <p>The game is simple game where words and characters drop from the top of the screen, and the player will have to accurately type them out to remove it from the screen.</p>
            
            <p>When the word drop to the bottom of the screen, it will destroy the buildings under it (cityline) as it hits.</p>
            
            <p>Once all the cityline is gone, the game is over.</p>
            <p>This game basically is a challenge of typing speed and accuracy.</p>

            <p>I've recreated this game in Python. This was a nostalgic game for me and a family passtime when I was a child. So I wanted to revisit this game.</p>
            <p>Source codes for this game can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/arynchoong/TypingTutorGame" target="_blank">https://github.com/arynchoong/TypingTutorGame</a></p>
            <p>To recreate this desktop game, we need the following:
            <ul>
                <li>List of words</li>
                <li>PyGame</li>
                <li>Game play</li>
                <li>Cityline</li>
                <li>Leveling up (game progression)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
